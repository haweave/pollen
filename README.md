# Pollen

_On a quest to see which place is the best._

Started searching for pollen data, ended up on a [NASA site](http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/KeywordSearch/Metadata.do?Portal=GCMD&KeywordPath=&EntryId=EARTH_ATM_NGDC_PALEO_POLLEN1&MetadataView=Data&MetadataType=0&lbnode=mdlb4), which lead me to [this site](http://hurricane.ncdc.noaa.gov/pls/paleox/f?p=518:1:2139012306693191:::APP:PROXYTOSEARCH:16:) for searching the databases, but there wasn't one for just North America. I next ended up on another [National Climatic Data Center site](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/pollen.html), which listed a [North American Pollen dataset](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye.pl?src=http://www.lpc.uottawa.ca/data/modern/). That seems legit. 

So I've started working with the dataset, cleaning it in refine and exporting it in various formats. Would love to get it small enough to fit into Google Docs but it's currently, even when I've isolated just the pollen data table, is over the 400,000 cell limit. 

### Do I have a plan?

Currently I'm playing with it (via Open Refine and TileMill) to see how the data relates to my actual allergies. I'll also at least clean it up to a sharable/manageable state and put it in this repo. Maybe do somethign else with it?

Also, I'm not a scientist. I don't really know how to use scientific data.
